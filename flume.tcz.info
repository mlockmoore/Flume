                Flume is a fast, light utilitarian math environment.  
                It can be used from the command-line for simple 
                calculations, or in GUI form as a desktop calculator or 
                a one-column spreadsheet. Flume uses the FLTK user 
                interface library, which makes it is especially 
                efficient on TinyCore Linux.
